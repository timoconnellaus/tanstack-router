Hosting is the process of deploying your application to the internet so that users can access it. This is a critical part of any web development project, ensuring your application is available to the world. TanStack Start is built on [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/), a powerful server toolkit for deploying web applications anywhere. Nitro allows TanStack Start to provide a unified API for SSR, streaming, and hydration on any hosting provider.

## What should I use?

TanStack Start is **designed to work with any hosting provider**, so if you already have a hosting provider in mind, you can deploy your application there using the full-stack APIs provided by TanStack Start.

However, since hosting is one of the most crucial aspects of your application's performance, reliability, and scalability, we highly recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=tanstack) for the best possible hosting experience.

## Deployment

> [!WARNING]
> The page is still a work in progress. We'll keep updating this page with guides on deployment to different hosting providers soon!

When a TanStack Start application is being deployed, the `server.preset` value in the `app.config.ts` file determines the deployment target. The deployment target can be set to one of the following values:

- [`vercel`](#vercel): Deploy to Vercel
- [`cloudflare-pages`](#cloudflare-pages): Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
- [`netlify`](#netlify): Deploy to Netlify
- [`node-server`](#nodejs): Deploy to a Node.js server
- [`bun`](#bun): Deploy to a Bun server
- ... and more to come!

Once you've chosen a deployment target, you can follow the deployment guidelines below to deploy your TanStack Start application to the hosting provider of your choice.

### Vercel

Deploying your TanStack Start application to Vercel is easy and straightforward. Just set the `server.preset` value to `vercel` in your `app.config.ts` file, and you're ready to deploy your application to Vercel.

```ts
// app.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@tanstack/start/config'

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    preset: 'vercel',
  },
})
```

Or you can use the `--preset` flag with the `build` command to specify the deployment target when building the application:

```sh
npm run build --preset vercel
```

Deploy you application to Vercel using their one-click deployment process, and you're ready to go!

### Cloudflare Pages

When deploying to Cloudflare Pages, you'll need to complete a few extra steps before your users can start using your app.

1. Installation

First you will need to install `unenv`

```sh
npm install unenv
```

2. Update `app.config.ts`

Set the `server.preset` value to `cloudflare-pages` and the `server.unenv` value to the `cloudflare` from `unenv` in your `app.config.ts` file.

```ts
// app.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@tanstack/start/config'
import { cloudflare } from 'unenv'

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    preset: 'cloudflare-pages',
    unenv: cloudflare,
  },
})
```

3. Add a `wrangler.toml` config file

```toml
# wrangler.toml
name = "your-cloudflare-project-name"
pages_build_output_dir = "./dist"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
compatibility_date = "2024-11-13"
```

Deploy you application to Cloudflare Pages using their one-click deployment process, and you're ready to go!

### Netlify

Set the `server.preset` value to `netlify` in your `app.config.ts` file.

```ts
// app.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@tanstack/start/config'

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    preset: 'netlify',
  },
})
```

Or you can use the `--preset` flag with the `build` command to specify the deployment target when building the application:

```sh
npm run build --preset netlify
```

Deploy you application to Netlify using their one-click deployment process, and you're ready to go!

### Node.js

Set the `server.preset` value to `node-server` in your `app.config.ts` file.

```ts
// app.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@tanstack/start/config'

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    preset: 'node-server',
  },
})

// Or you can use the --preset flag with the build command
// to specify the deployment target when building the application:
// npm run build --preset node-server
```

Then you can run the following command to build and start your application:

```sh
npm run build
```

You're now ready to deploy your application to a Node.js server. You can start your application by running:

```sh
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

### Bun

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, the Bun specific deployment guidelines only work with React 19. If you are using React 18, please refer to the [Node.js](#nodejs) deployment guidelines.

Make sure that your `react` and `react-dom` packages are set to version 19.0.0 or higher in your `package.json` file. If not, run the following command to upgrade the packages:

```sh
npm install react@rc react-dom@rc
```

Set the `server.preset` value to `bun` in your `app.config.ts` file.

```ts
// app.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@tanstack/start/config'

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    preset: 'bun',
  },
})

// Or you can use the --preset flag with the build command
// to specify the deployment target when building the application:
// npm run build --preset bun
```

Then you can run the following command to build and start your application:

```sh
bun run build
```

You're now ready to deploy your application to a Bun server. You can start your application by running:

```sh
bun run .output/server/index.mjs
```
